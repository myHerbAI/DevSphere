```
src/types.ts src/components/ScoreCard.tsx src/components/RecommendationList.tsx src/App.tsx index.html npm run dev 
```

#### I've created a beautiful and functional sustainability checker application with the following features:

Modern, minimalist design with a clean color scheme Comprehensive scoring system across multiple metrics Visual scorecards with intuitive icons.

{% hint style="info" %}
Detailed recommendations with impact levels Responsive layout that works on all devices Smooth animations and transitions Accessibility-focused design Clear visual hierarchy.
{% endhint %}

#### The application is now running locally and deployed to Netlify. You can:

Enter any website URL to analyze. View comprehensive sustainability scores. Get actionable recommendations. See impact levels and categories for each recommendation. The demo data shows how the application will work once connected to a real sustainability-checking API.
