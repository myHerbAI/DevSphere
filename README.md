## Sync [HubSpot](https://myherb.co.il/hubspot/) with Mailchimp & Customer.io

Sync [HubSpot](https://guide.myherb.co.il) with Mailchimp & Customer.io “Anytime a new contact property change is created in HubSpot, add/update a subscriber in Mailchimp and create or update a person in Customer.io.

Zapier allows seamless integration between different apps and platforms, making your workflow more efficient and streamlined. One of the many powerful features of Zapier is the ability to create a "zap" that triggers an action in one app based on an event in another app."

### **Manage subscribers on multiple platforms with one Zap**

_In this case, we will use_ [_HubSpot_](https://guide.myherb.co.il)_, Mailchimp, and Customer.io to demonstrate how to automatically add or update subscribers across various platforms with just one zap._

1. First, let's set up the trigger for our zap. In [HubSpot](https://guide.myherb.co.il/), we have a contact property change as our trigger event. Our zap will be triggered whenever a new contact property is created or updated in [HubSpot](https://guide.myherb.co.il).
2. Next, we will select Mailchimp as our action app. We want to add the new or updated contact in [HubSpot](https://guide.myherb.co.il) as a subscriber to our Mailchimp audience. Zapier will automatically pull in all your Mailchimp lists, so you can choose which one to add the subscriber.
3. Once we have selected our action app and account, we can map the fields from our trigger app ([HubSpot](https://guide.myherb.co.il)) to our action app (Mailchimp).&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
This is where Zapier's "magic" happens—it takes information from one app and seamlessly transfers it to another.

### Effortlessly Transfer Contacts Between HubSpot and Mailchimp using Zapier

For example, we can map the first name, last name, and email address fields from [HubSpot](https://guide.myherb.co.il) to the corresponding fields in Mailchimp. This ensures that all contact information is accurately transferred.

But what if we want to add more information, such as the contact's job title or company name? No problem—Zapier allows us to add custom fields to our mapping. This means we can transfer any additional information from [HubSpot](https://guide.myherb.co.il) and have it automatically added to the subscriber's profile in Mailchimp.

In addition to adding new contacts, Zapier can update existing contacts in Mailchimp. This is extremely helpful for keeping our audience data up-to-date without manually changing both apps.

### Streamline Your Marketing Efforts with Zapier's Automation Process

Zapier's automation process saves us time and effort and ensures that our contact information is always accurate and consistent across both platforms. No more worrying about outdated or incomplete subscriber lists – with Zapier, all our data is synced and organized seamlessly.

But Zapier doesn't just stop at syncing contacts – it can also automate other tasks, such as creating new Mailchimp campaigns based on [HubSpot](https://guide.myherb.co.il) triggers. This means we can easily set up automated email marketing campaigns triggered by specific actions or events within our [HubSpot](https://guide.myherb.co.il) platform."

### Maximizing Email Marketing Efficiency with Zapier Integration

We can also use Zapier to track and analyze the success of our email marketing efforts by integrating Mailchimp with other analytics tools. With Zapier, we have access to powerful reporting features that allow us to monitor the performance of our email campaigns and make informed decisions about future strategies.
