## Tips for Sustainable Tech Usage

In this modern age of technology, sustainability is a crucial consideration for all digital consumers. Implementing simple adjustments in your daily tech routine can significantly reduce your carbon footprint. Below are some highlighted tips to increase the sustainability of your tech usage:

### Adjust Screen Brightness

Reducing the brightness of your digital screens can contribute substantially to energy conservation. Lowering your screen brightness by 10% can save up to 1.44 kg of CO2e annually. This adjustment not only reduces energy consumption but also extends the lifespan of your device screens, ultimately leading to a more sustainable usage pattern.

### Enable Power Saving Mode

Most digital devices come equipped with power-saving modes, designed to optimize battery life. By enabling these features, you can reduce the energy consumption of your electronics. This mode adjusts the performance and settings of your device, thereby conserving energy and contributing to sustainable tech use.

### Unplug Chargers When Not in Use

Many users leave chargers plugged into outlets even when they are not in use, leading to unnecessary energy consumption. Known as standby power or "phantom load," this can account for up to 10% of your device’s energy usage. By simply unplugging chargers when they aren't actively charging a device, you can eliminate this waste and lower your energy bills.

### Eco-Friendly Browsing Habits

The way you browse the internet can also impact sustainability. Consider using search engines like Ecosia, which plant trees with their ad revenue. Limiting video streaming and cutting down on unnecessary browsing can further reduce energy consumption. Being mindful of your online activities can lead to a more sustainable digital footprint.

### Schedule Device Upgrades

Constantly upgrading to the latest devices contributes to the growing problem of electronic waste. Instead, aim to upgrade your devices every 3–4 years and ensure that your old devices are recycled properly. Recycling old electronics prevents harmful materials from entering landfills and reduces the need for new resources.

By incorporating these sustainable practices into your tech routine, you can play a part in reducing environmental impact and promote the longevity of your devices. Remember, small steps in sustainability can lead to
