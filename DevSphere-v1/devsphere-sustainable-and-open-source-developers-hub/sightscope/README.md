   * User Engagement
4. **Recommendations Engine**: Based on the scorecard, our AI chatbot provides prioritized recommendations for improvement, including:
   * Code optimization
   * Image compression
   * Content strategy
   * Server optimization
   * Renewable energy sources
5. **Report Generation:** A comprehensive report is generated, including:
   * Executive summary
   * Scorecard
