```python
import time

def water_tree():
    print("Watering the tree...")
    # Code to activate a water irrigation system or water the tree manually
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulating the time it takes to water the tree
    print("Tree has been watered.")

# Check if the tree needs watering based on soil moisture level
def check_moisture_level():
    # Code to check the moisture level of the soil around the tree
    moisture_level = get_moisture_level()  # Function to get moisture level
    if moisture_level < 50:  # Adjust the threshold according to tree's needs
        water_tree()

# Run the code periodically to check and water the tree
while True:
    check_moisture_level()
    time.sleep(3600)  # Run the check every hour
```

#### Eco-Friendly Tree Watering Code Explanation

This code snippet showcases a simple Python script designed to automate the watering of a tree based on soil moisture levels in an eco-friendly way.

**Key Components:**

1. **water\_tree Function:**
   * Simulates the action of watering a tree.
   * Prints a message indicating the commencement of watering.
   * Includes a delay to represent the watering duration with `time.sleep(2)`.
2. **check\_moisture\_level Function:**
   * Monitors soil moisture to determine if the tree needs watering.
   * Calls `get_moisture_level()` to obtain the current moisture level (assuming this function is implemented).
   * If the moisture level falls below a set threshold (e.g., 50), the tree is watered by calling `water_tree()`.
3. **Continuous Monitoring Loop:**
   * The script checks the moisture level every hour using a `while True` loop combined with `time.sleep(3600)` to ensure regular hydration checks for the tree.

Adjust the moisture threshold (`< 50`) based on specific tree requirements. The design assumes access to soil moisture sensor data via

### What does this code do?

This code periodically checks the soil's moisture level around the tree and waters the tree if the moisture level falls below a certain threshold (in this case, 50%).&#x20;

It then waits for an hour before checking again to avoid over-watering. Feel free to customize the code based on the specific requirements of your tree and watering system.
